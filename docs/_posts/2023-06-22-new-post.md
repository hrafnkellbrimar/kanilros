<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Both of my albums I have released since April are available on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BandLab?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BandLab</a> which is really the source, since I recorded both of them entirely in their browser interface. I must give <a href="https://twitter.com/BandLab?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BandLab</a> the loudest shoutout for making this possible. <a href="https://t.co/NRU7okdS5Q">https://t.co/NRU7okdS5Q</a></p>&mdash; Kanilrós (@kanilros) <a href="https://twitter.com/kanilros/status/1671881393746612224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 22, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
